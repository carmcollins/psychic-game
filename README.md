# Psychic Game

### About The Project

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a psychic game. The basis of the game is that the user selects a letter on their keyboard and the computer selects a random letter.

If the letters are the same:
* The user wins
* Their win count increases by 1
* The game resets so they can play again

If the letters are not the same:
* The user's guesses left decreases by 1
* Their guess is logged on the page under letters already guessed

The user has 10 chances to try to guess the same letter as the computer.
When the user's chances reaches 0:
* The user loses
* Their losses count increases by 1
* The game resets and they can play again
